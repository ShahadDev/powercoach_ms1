#User Experience
â€”
### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Powercoach target users are:
* Male and Female
* Aged 18-45
* Active individuals looking to perform better in the gym
* People interested in powerlifting
* Enquiring regarding coaching and programming.

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Informative website with visible success stories
* Method of contact
* Find out more about powerlifting.

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is what fears most people from strength development.

Due to the age group of the users, it can be expected that the site will receive traffic from a variety of different devices. Thus, a responsive design will be undertaken for success with a mobile first approach.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Discount banner
- Gallery of images of coaching sessions
- Information section regarding powerlifting breakdown of the three core lifts
- Information Regarding the Team
- Method of contact/enquiries via a form.
- Links to affiliate social media pages/Socials
- Footer giving our location details
---


---
### **Structure** 

This is a single-page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever section of the site they are interested in or they can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed. It is dynamic to toggle between a burger bar and navigational links.

I chose the following order for the information 

1.Home
2.About Powerlifting
3.Services
4.The team
4.Sign Up/Enquiries 
5.Socials

This flow kept a conscious effort in maintaining what a normal enquiry to a coach may look like, what is it that you do? What do you offer? Who is involved? Sign me up? How can we keep in contact? Each section is broken down to allow digestible chunks of info. Finally, there is a simple sign up form for users to sign up and contact the coach.

### **Skeleton**

![wireframe-figma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93746419/140823861-1fa3b5bb-7e1a-4ad2-831d-317dab66d33d.png)

Please note the actual website has changed slightly from these wireframes. These are high level and with more time the would be more define and would have more details

With more time I would have had a more detailed design with colors and images.

Whilst building the website I felt that there were sections with too much information, for this reason, I opted to install the read more button on all devices and not just the mobile. This allows for user's to only read on if they would like the more detailed information; I felt giving the user this control would provide a positive user experience. 

I also decided to change my photo slideshow with a bootstrap carousel with a timer to switch it also allowed for better responsiveness and the images looked better on larger screens. 

In addition to these changes I also decided to add a socials section using font awesome with some hover animation. 

The jumbotron promo offer moves and eventually removes depending on device scale, the value of it being there wasn't necessary on smaller devices.

### **Surface**

The colour palette is based around a balance between white and black, typical colours found on gym equipment and instruction manuals (as this is a coaching site this is relevant to the them). The users should find clear and concise information presented in a clean contrasting design principle to enable the text to shine.

Google fonts poppins was used as I researched common gym fonts on websites using google developer tools. I tried to keep it simple and used out of the box bootstrap classes to hide/emphasise text.
---

---
## **Features**

This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; 

1.Home
2.About Powerlifting
3.Services
4.The team
4.Sign Up/Enquiries 
5.Socials

all of the headings use the font Cookie and the body text is poppins, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design. 

### *Navbar*
The navbar is placed on top of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen.
The image I have chosen is representative of the site's theme and incorporates the colour palette, it was kept simple and clear - to emphasise the gallery below.

### *About powerlifting*
This is where I introduced what the coach focuses on, a brief insight into the lifts we work on. I have used an H1 element for the main heading, followed by an p tag line with a lead class using bootstrap and then a more descriptive paragraph. I wanted to keep this section simple and clean as there is plenty of information that follows.


### *Services*
Section comprises of H2, P, H4 with an unordered list to emphasise the service we offer. this structure is used to provide clarity of the items within this section and make it easy to understand at a glance. 

### *The team*
This section is a dynamic box using bootstrap detailing information about the team which will help you achieve your goals. It is simple and breaks down the teams area of interest and strengths.

### *Sign Up/Enquiries*
A simple form was used and central to emphasis its important, after seeing all the information. Why would you not want to sign up? It is responsive and dynamic.

### *Socials*
Large font awesome icons were used to emphasise our social presence and footprint accross all digital platforms.

## Testing

### **User Stories**



1. **As a first-time visitor, I want to easily find useful information regarding the coaches and the team.**
Users can navigate quickly to our services or meet the team from the navbar and find out more.

2. **As a first-time visitor, I want to find inspiration for powerlifting and what it focuses on**
Users can navigate to the powerlifting section, the gallery also provides inspiration regarding the coaching strategy. There is a section and advice on areas breaking down what type of lifts are involved

3. **As a first-time user, I want to be able to sign up to directly receive content via a newsletter.**
Users can navigate directly to the form and contact the team.

### **Lighthouse**

Lighthouse is a feature of Google Chrome developer tools and is used to assess the performance of the website and its features. I achieved a low-performance score initially, as you can see below:

![lighthouse-results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93746419/140823279-24f41826-771f-40dc-94d7-b0b50abb9f31.png)

I achieved fantastic results by minimising the amount of data needed on the page, Furthermore, I added the 'rel="noreferrer"' to all external links as this is considered best practice. 
I have nearly achieved 90 across the board.


### **HTML and CSS Validation**

I validated both my HTML and CSS code multiple times whilst building the website, I did this so that there were not a huge amount of errors/warnings at the final stages of development for me to deal with. This allowed me to incrementally improve my code and upon completion, there were 0 errors found.

## **Known bugs and fixes**

As part of my testing I wanted to ensure that all of my clickable links worked & opened up in a new page, I found that social links do not work.

In future implementation I would look to add actual pages but as this is an fictional business there was nothing to refer to

The bugs have been fixed to purely open the home pages now.

Throughout the entire process, I used Google Dev Tools and Unicorn revealer to debug the website and its layout, this allowed me to check the responsiveness of the site and quickly debug any issues that I came across. 



## Deployment

I deployed this website by using GitPages and following the below steps:

*GitHub pages deployment* 

1. Log in to GitHub
2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click 'Settings'
4. Select 'Pages' on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
5. In the source section, select branch 'Master' and save
6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following: 


Please note it can take a while for this link to become fully active. 

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
